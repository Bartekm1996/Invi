# User Guide


### The Login Screen


Each user must has own personal account. Never use another person's login, account, or email address. 
Your personal account enables you to create or rent own cart and purchase chosen items. This application can then be used to apply for current and future order openings.
There are four options to login as an User:
        
1. Email way with email confirmation link sent to your email account
- If you already have an account: Enter your Email or phone number, next enter Password.
- If you do not have an account:  Enter your Email or phone number, next enter Password. 
After successful login, for security reasons, you will be asked about email and phone verification.

2. Link with your Google account
3. Link with your Facebook account
4. Link with your Twitter account
