Invi was created by the collaboration of three students of the University Of Limerick.

<ul>
<li>Bartlomiej Mlynarkiewicz <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Bartekm1996">GitHub - Bartekm1996</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Paul Kinsella  <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/pk-development">GitHub - pk-development</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Norbert Cholewka <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/nch-development">GitHub - nch-development</a></li></ul></li>
</ul>

The creators of Invi have completed several projects together to date, sharing
different skills sets made the fruition of Invi possible. Having gained invaluable
experience during their internships in the following places

<ul>
<li>Bartlomiej Mlynarkiewicz - Mentor Graphics by Siemens</li>
<li>Paul Kinsella - Analog Devices</li>
<li>Norbert Cholewka - Action Point</li>
</ul>

they were able to translate the knowledge and experience gained into a successful
project that has the potential of increasing the convenience of everyday shopping
but also shrinking waiting times and minimizing human interaction which
could be revolutionary, especially during times we are currently experiencing.
