Invi was initially an idea for inventory management for one of the University Of Limerick Clubs,
but we quickly realised it's potential and transformed it into self check out App. Currently,
with the help on Invi, the user can check prices of several products in real-time. It uses
the EAN number from the barcode and queries Tesco's API for the result. The price returned can be
then quickly converted at current currency exchange rates into several currencies. Invi also allows to
self check out rent items by scanning their QR Code it than tracks the time on lease and applies the
applicable daily rates. It has been proven very useful even for our selves. Being able to price check
within the store using your smartphone is an enormous convenience.

<strong>This guide is to show Invis attached benefits. To learn how to use Invi please refer here <a href="https://www.invi.store/usageguide/" target="_self">Invis User Guide</a><strong>

Currently Invi supports two methods or registration

<ul>
<li><strong>1. Using Social Media Accounts Including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram</strong></li>
<li><strong>2. Using Email Address</strong></li>
</ul>

### Invis Login Screen

</p>

However, when signing up using one of the mentioned social accounts, the user still needs to verify both
your email and phone number. Invi requires email and phone verification to make the account more secure
but also to verify that it's a real user signing up to the service. Another benefit of registering using
social media accounts is that information such as the users profile photo, name and email address will be
used by Invi.

If the user decided to sign up with his social media account, he will be redirected to a permission screen
by the chosen social media to grant Invi permission to use his details -

    Email
    Name,
    Profile Photo

Once permission is granted the user will be then redirected to the registration screen where details such
as his name and email will be perilled. The user is required than to enter a username and a password
which has to meet Invi requirements, alternatively his/she can use Invi password generator.

Upon successful registration the user will be sent a verification email and an (OTP) One Time Password to his/her
phone to verify their humanity. Until verified successfully the user will be presented with verification is complete.

Once verified the user will be able to also Log In using his phone number as Invi will send an (OTP) One Time
Password to the users device, which is then valid for the duration of five minutes.
Which is an attractive feature to many users as it takes the burden away of remembering the password.
Using social media also offers this benefit or password less singing as the user is verified by his social
media account.

Upon successful verification, the user will be welcomed by the home screen. Which shows a summary of recent
transaction with the sum spent to date with along with the payment form of the transaction,
items currently rented and a pie chart summarising the categories of the items the user recently
purchased. The user will also be asked to grant permission for Invi to have access to the devices

    Camera
    NFC (Near Field Communication)
