Invi is a mobile application which allows users to self-checkout in stores who opt to integrate this application. Invi also permits stores who offer equipment renting such as bikes, kayaks or scooters to self-rent the asset by scanning a QR code on the asset which will then link it with your account until returned. Using Invi for self-checkout aims to reduce ques, enlarge store space by removing more tills which will translate into extra rows for products and an increase in revenue. As the user conveniently scans items while putting them in his/her trolley or basket, it will check if a cheaper alternative product is available. 

At the same time, it will automatically add the item to your cart in-app, this doe's not only cut queuing time but allows stores to tailor ads based on your past purchases but also time sent in a specific row. This also makes shopping less stressful and time-consuming. Invi will implement live time in-store tracking, which will enable the store to push live notifications of any offers in the row you're currently in and any pending offers in stores. Invi also has an option to price check to decide whether to purchase it or not. If a particular product is not available within the store, the can either search for it within the App or scan the barcode / QR code of the product on the shelf and Invi will automatically search for it in nearby stores who also use Invi. The final idea is to implement physical shop cart synchronization, which will have a QR code attached to it. 

Once the user scans that QR code the trolley/basket will be automatically be linked to his/her phone until shopping is finished and the users check out. Similar to the current self-checkout stations, the trolley/basket will have an integrated weighing scale. It will trigger a notification if the weight doesn't match with the products scanned. If the notification is not responded to within two minutes, the trolley will flash red and lock the user out displaying a QR code on the phone screen which will only allow the store's staff to scan and unlock the temporary lock, preventing theft.

Currently, Invi uses Firebase as it's the main framework for authentication, storage, and analytics. Invi has social platforms Google, Facebook and Twitter integrated for login but also for sharing any offer the user came across in-store or his/her recent purchases. Currently, the user can register using the aforementioned platforms or using his email.

Once the user registers using his/her social platform accounts Invi checks if the user exists, if not it will take him/her to the registration page prefiling his/her name, surname and email requiring a password to be entered. Once that's done the user will then be taken to the verification page requiring the user to verify his phone and email, this page will persist not permitting the user to use the App until he/she verifies both.
